# E-Commerce Back End

With the ever-growing prevalence of e-commerce, it is increasingly important to stay organized. This application allows just that with the easy retrieval of entire and specific categories, products, and tags. The user can also add, update, and delete them.

This application showcases a backend made possible by express.js and sequelize.

## Installation and Usage

After installing node package manager and the dependencies of dotenv@8.2.0 express@4.17.1 mysql2@2.1.0 sequelize@5.21.7, the user can create an environment variables file (.env) to store sensitive information during use. 

Then, initiate the database via MySQL, and seed the data with 'npm run seed'.

Finally, run the command 'npm start' or 'node server.js', and engage with the application via your API interface of choice.
